Enhance Content Representation:

Problem: 

Wikipedia articles may contain unconscious gender bias. In the digital age, where information is accessible to millions, unconscious gender bias persists in Wikipedia articles, shaping perceptions and reinforcing stereotypes. Despite efforts, articles often unintentionally favor one gender, limiting the representation and diversity of perspectives. This bias not only distorts the historical record but also perpetuates inequalities.


Solution: 

To address the issue of unconscious gender bias in Wikipedia articles, we propose a solution that involves the development of a sophisticated tool. Leveraging a pretrained model from Hugging Face called "koelectra-base-v3-gender-bias," this tool utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques to analyze content within articles and systematically flagging potential gender bias, the tool empowers Wikipedia editors to create more balanced content.

Conclusion:


In conclusion, our project addresses the pervasive issue of unconscious gender bias in Wikipedia articles by introducing a powerful tool powered by the "koelectra-base-v3-gender-bias" pretrained model from Hugging Face. Through sophisticated natural language processing techniques, the tool systematically analyzes language usage, topic coverage, and citation patterns within articles, providing valuable insights to Wikipedia editors. By flagging potential gender bias, our solution empowers editors to craft content that is more inclusive and balanced. As we strive to enhance content representation, our project contributes to creating a digital knowledge landscape that accurately reflects the diverse perspectives and valuable contributions of individuals across genders. Through this initiative, we aspire to foster a more equitable and unbiased portrayal of information on one of the most widely accessed platforms for knowledge dissemination.
